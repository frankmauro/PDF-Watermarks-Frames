# PDF Watermarks Frames
Developed by Marcello Silvestri and Francesco Mauro

PDF Watermarks & Frames allows you to apply watermarks with custom scale and opacity on every single page of a PDF document.

Additionally, you can also add a frame to that document.

You can find the documentation inside of the documentation folder. At the moment, it is only available in Italian language, but we plan to translate the comments in the code and the documentation itself soon.
